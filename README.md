## Why Eclipse

Eclipse was designed to bridge Luna services (more well known as Sora modules) with Stremio addons in one polished app. The goal is simple: search faster, pick the right result with better metadata, watch with stronger controls, keep progress synced, and continue across anime, movies, shows, manga, and novels. Now powered by Mangayomi, SkyStream, and Nuvio as well. Star the repo, join the Discord, or support on Ko-fi if you like my work!

## Support

- Join the Discord server for help, updates, and community discussion: https://discord.gg/UjHgGaEbn
- Ko-fi is available if you want to support development: https://ko-fi.com/soupydev but it will never unlock features or paywall anything. It's just a way to support development if you want to. And no, ads/telemetry will never be a thing in this app, so you don't have to worry about that either.

## Notes

- MPV is the advanced in-app player and is default
- VLC is not supported anymore, but may come back if v4 is good.
- Use GitHub Issues or the discord for feature requests and bug reports.
- Development started in December 2025
- Ipas are no longer supported


## Bring Your Own Sources

Eclipse ships as an app shell and media manager. It does not provide hosted media, built-in piracy sources, or bundled addons.

Users are responsible for the services and addons they choose to add. The app and developer do not support piracy.

To add a service/addon, click the top right settings icon in the homescreen and then click services. Then click the top right plus icon and choose whichever type of link you copied.


## Credits and acknowledgements

Eclipse is built on the work of many projects and services:

- [Luna](https://github.com/cranci1/Luna) is the original upstream project from which Eclipse was derived.
- [SkyStream](https://github.com/akashdh11/skystream), created by Akash, defined the plugin format and behavior supported by Eclipse's SkyStream compatibility layer. SkyStream plugins are independent projects and are not bundled with Eclipse.
- [SkyStream Tools](https://github.com/akashdh11/skystream-tools) (GPLv3) provides the reference SDK and extractor behavior adapted by Eclipse's local compatibility layer.
- [Nuvio](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioMobile) defined the plugin format and behavior supported by Eclipse's Nuvio compatibility layer. Nuvio plugins are independent projects and are not bundled with Eclipse.
- [SoraCore](https://github.com/cranci1/SoraCore) (GPLv3) is no longer linked as a dependency, but Eclipse's local service runtime and network layer are adapted from it.
- Runtime libraries and components include [FakeWebKit](https://github.com/undeaDD/FakeWebKit) (GPLv3), [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) (MIT), [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) (MIT), [PLCrashReporter](https://github.com/microsoft/plcrashreporter), [SwiftSoup](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup) (MIT), [Texture](https://github.com/Skittyblock/Texture) (Apache 2.0), [Wasm3](https://github.com/Skittyblock/Wasm3) (MIT), and [ZIPFoundation](https://github.com/weichsel/ZIPFoundation) (MIT).
- Playback uses Eclipse's [MPVKit fork](https://github.com/Soupy-dev/MPVKit), based on [MPVKit](https://github.com/mpvkit/MPVKit), and the multimedia projects bundled by MPVKit, including [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg), and [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK).
- The Enhanced Upscaling options bundle third-party mpv user shaders under `Eclipse/Player/Shaders`, each alongside its full license text: [ArtCNN](https://github.com/Artoriuz/ArtCNN) (`ArtCNN_C4F16.glsl` and the denoise-and-sharpen `ArtCNN_C4F16_DS.glsl`, MIT, © 2024 Joao Chrisostomo and Kacper Michajłow) for animation, and [AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR) (`AMD_FSR1_EASU_RCAS.glsl`, MIT, © 2021 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) for live action. Eclipse's mpv GLSL adaptation of FSR 1 is based on hooke007's `AMD_FSR1_RT` port and uses EASU with conservative RCAS sharpening. The shader files are also their corresponding source.
- Optional metadata, tracking, subtitle, schedule, mapping, and skip-data features use services including [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), [AniList](https://anilist.co), [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net), [Trakt](https://trakt.tv), [TVmaze](https://www.tvmaze.com), [Jikan](https://jikan.moe), [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io), [AniMap](https://animap.s0n1c.ca), [AniSkip](https://aniskip.com), [TheIntroDB](https://theintrodb.org), [IntroDB](https://introdb.app), [OpenSubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.com), and the [Stremio addon protocol](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk).
